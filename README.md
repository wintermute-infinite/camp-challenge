Until this is finished, I will add my notes and thoughts as written on my personal whiteboard, to document and track what I'm thinking.

There are 2 primary considerations in completing this: problem solution and optimizations. I will first prioritize finding a solution, then optimzing and refactoring to ensure maintainability and an adherence to OOP.

Solution:

The starting point for the solution will be in calculating the existing reservations' gaps and then comparing them to the search terms

Optimizations:

- Create campsite class
-- props for id (int), name (string) and reservations (array)
-- instantiate campsite objects using json_decode data

- organize file structure
